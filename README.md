===========
1) how to install the package, 2) list any dependencies, and 3) give examples of how to run the program(s)

1) Installation Instructions:
This file will work once the package is unzipped.


2) Dependencies:
Diag account
PATH to Trinity in bash file
Must have Trimmomatic on server and know the path (use 'pwd' in the directory)
Must have a gmail account

3) How to Run program:
First, change path to your own path.  You must also change the email and password to your own gmail account.  Unfortunately the gmail password is hardcoded.  Next, in the directory that the script is in, type 'nohup python CompleteTrinity.py &' to run the program.  Additionally, you can change which files are run and include those files in the multiprocessing steps.
